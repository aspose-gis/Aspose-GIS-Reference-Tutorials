## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: 대용량 Shapefile(수백 MB)을 GeoJSON으로 변환할 때 메모리 부족 문제가 발생하지 않나요?**  
A: Yes. Use the streaming API provided by Aspose.GIS, which reads and writes features incrementally to keep memory usage low.

**Q: 변환 과정에서 좌표계 변환을 지원하나요?**  
A: Absolutely. You can re‑project geometries while converting, e.g., from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857, using the built‑in `CoordinateSystem` utilities.

**Q: GeoJSON으로 변환할 때 사용자 정의 속성이나 스타일 정보를 추가하려면 어떻게 해야 하나요?**  
A: Attach attribute data to each feature before export; the library serializes all attributes into the GeoJSON `properties` object.

**Q: GeoJSON을 Shapefile로 다시 변환하는 것이 가능한가요 (convert geojson to shapefile)?**  
A: Yes—Aspose.GIS provides a reverse conversion method that writes a Shapefile while preserving attribute schemas.

**Q: shapefile을 geojson으로 변환하는 샘플 코드는 어디서 찾을 수 있나요?**  
A: Sample projects are included in the **GeoData Conversion** tutorial section linked above.
