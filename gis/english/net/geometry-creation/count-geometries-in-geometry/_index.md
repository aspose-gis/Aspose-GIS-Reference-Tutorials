# Count Geometries in Geometry with Aspose.GIS

## Introduction
Aspose.GIS for .NET is a powerful tool for developers seeking to incorporate geospatial functionality into their .NET applications. Whether you're building mapping software, location-based services, or spatial analytics tools, Aspose.GIS provides a comprehensive set of features to meet your needs. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to count geometries within a geometry using Aspose.GIS for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.GIS for .NET: Download and install Aspose.GIS for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics.

## Import Namespaces
Before you start coding, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.GIS functionality.

```csharp
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 2: Create Point Geometry
```csharp
Point point = new Point(40.7128, -74.006);
```
Here, we create a `Point` geometry with latitude 40.7128 and longitude -74.006.
## Step 3: Create LineString Geometry
```csharp
LineString line = new LineString();
line.AddPoint(78.65, -32.65);
line.AddPoint(-98.65, 12.65);
```
This step creates a `LineString` geometry and adds two points to it.
## Step 4: Create Geometry Collection
```csharp
GeometryCollection geometryCollection = new GeometryCollection();
geometryCollection.Add(point);
geometryCollection.Add(line);
```
We then create a `GeometryCollection` and add the previously created point and line geometries to it.
## Step 5: Count Geometries
```csharp
int geometriesCount = geometryCollection.Count;
```
This step counts the number of geometries within the `GeometryCollection`.
## Step 6: Display the Count
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(geometriesCount); // 2
```
Finally, we print out the count of geometries, which in this case is `2`.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to count geometries within a geometry using Aspose.GIS for .NET. By following these steps, you can incorporate geospatial functionality into your .NET applications with ease.
