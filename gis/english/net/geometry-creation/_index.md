# Create MultiLineString Geometry

## Introduction

If you're a .NET developer looking to **create multiline string** geometry quickly and reliably, you’ve come to the right place. Aspose.GIS for .NET provides a rich, easy‑to‑use API that lets you build, edit, and analyze spatial objects without the hassle of low‑level GIS libraries. In this guide we’ll walk through the basics of creating a multiline string, explore related geometry types such as compound curves and geometry collections, and point you to the next steps for counting points, converting coordinates, and more.

## Quick Answers
- **What is a MultiLineString?** A collection of two or more LineString objects that share the same coordinate reference system.  
- **Why use Aspose.GIS for .NET?** It offers a pure‑managed API, no native dependencies, and full support for .NET 5/6/7.  
- **Do I need a license?** A free trial works for development; a commercial license is required for production.  
- **Which .NET versions are supported?** .NET Framework 4.5+, .NET Core 3.1+, and .NET 5+.  
- **Can I convert the geometry to other formats?** Yes – you can export to WKT, GeoJSON, Shapefile, and more.

## What is a MultiLineString Geometry?
A **MultiLineString** represents multiple line strings grouped as a single spatial object. It’s useful for modeling road networks, river systems, or any set of connected line features that should be treated together.

## Why create multiline string geometry?
Creating a multiline string lets you:
- **Represent complex linear features** without breaking them into separate layers.  
- **Perform spatial analysis** (e.g., length calculations, intersection tests) on the whole collection at once.  
- **Export or share** data in standard GIS formats that support multi‑part geometries.

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (or any .NET IDE you prefer).  
- Aspose.GIS for .NET NuGet package installed (`Install-Package Aspose.GIS`).  
- Basic familiarity with C# and GIS concepts.

## Step‑by‑Step Guide to Create a MultiLineString

### Step 1: Initialize the Geometry Factory
Start by creating a `GeometryFactory` instance that will generate all geometry objects.

### Step 2: Build Individual LineString Objects
Create each `LineString` you want to include in the multi‑part geometry. Provide the coordinate pairs that define each line.

### Step 3: Combine LineStrings into a MultiLineString
Pass the collection of `LineString` objects to the `CreateMultiLineString` method of the factory.

### Step 4: Use the MultiLineString
You can now add the geometry to a feature, write it to a file, or perform spatial queries.

> **Note:** The actual C# code for these steps is identical across all Aspose.GIS tutorials that deal with geometry creation. Refer to the linked tutorials for the exact code snippets.
