# Limit Precision Reading Geometries with Aspose.GIS for .NET

## Introduction
In the realm of geospatial data manipulation, Aspose.GIS for .NET stands as a powerful tool, offering a myriad of functionalities to developers and engineers alike. One such capability is the ability to limit precision when reading geometries, a crucial aspect in certain applications where precision might not be paramount. In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to achieve this using Aspose.GIS for .NET, breaking down the process into manageable steps.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation: Aspose.GIS for .NET library should be installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from the [releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
2. Familiarity with .NET: Basic knowledge of C# and the .NET framework is necessary to understand and implement the provided code examples.
3. Development Environment: A working .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio, is required.
4. Document Directory: Have a directory set up where you can store and access the shapefile generated during the process.

## Import Namespaces
Before we begin implementing the functionality to limit precision when reading geometries, let's ensure we import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Formats.Shapefile;
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using Aspose.GIS.Examples.CSharp;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 1: Creating a Vector Layer
Firstly, we need to create a vector layer where we can add our geometries. This can be achieved using the following code snippet:
```csharp
string path = "Your Document Directory" + "LimitPrecisionWhenReadingGeometries_out.shp";
using (VectorLayer layer = VectorLayer.Create(path, Drivers.Shapefile))
{
	var feature = layer.ConstructFeature();
	feature.Geometry = new Point(1.10234, 2.09743);
	layer.Add(feature);
}
```
## Step 2: Setting Precision Options
Next, we need to define options for reading geometries, specifying the desired precision model. We can do this as follows:
```csharp
var options = new ShapefileOptions();
// read data as-is.
options.XYPrecisionModel = PrecisionModel.Exact;
```
## Step 3: Reading Geometries with Exact Precision
Now, let's open the vector layer with the specified options to read geometries with exact precision:
```csharp
using (VectorLayer layer = VectorLayer.Open(path, Drivers.Shapefile, options))
{
	var point = (IPoint)layer[0].Geometry;
	// 1.10234, 2.09743
	Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", point.X, point.Y);
}
```
## Step 4: Truncating Precision
Finally, if we want to truncate the precision to a specific number of decimal places, we can adjust the precision model accordingly:
```csharp
options.XYPrecisionModel = PrecisionModel.Rounding(2);
using (VectorLayer layer = VectorLayer.Open(path, Drivers.Shapefile, options))
{
	var point = (IPoint)layer[0].Geometry;
	// 1.1, 2.1
	Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", point.X, point.Y);
}
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, managing precision when reading geometries is a crucial aspect of geospatial data manipulation. Aspose.GIS for .NET provides robust functionalities to achieve this efficiently. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly limit precision according to your requirements, ensuring optimal data handling in your applications.
