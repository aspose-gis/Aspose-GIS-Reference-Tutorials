## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to define a precision grid for a File Geodatabase (GDB) layer using Aspose.GIS for .NET. Aspose.GIS is a powerful .NET library that provides comprehensive geospatial functionality to work with various GIS file formats.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.GIS for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.GIS for .NET library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial for understanding the code examples.
## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.GIS:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Formats.FileGdb;
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using Aspose.Gis.SpatialReferencing;
using System;
using System.Text;
```
Now, let's break down each step of defining a precision grid for a File GDB layer.
## Step 1: Create a Dataset
```csharp
var path = "Your Document Directory" + "PrecisionGrid_out.gdb";
using (var dataset = Dataset.Create(path, Drivers.FileGdb))
{
```
Here, we create a new dataset in a File Geodatabase format by specifying the path and using the `Dataset.Create` method.
## Step 2: Define Precision Grid Options
```csharp
var options = new FileGdbOptions
{
    CoordinatePrecisionGrid = new FileGdbCoordinatePrecisionGrid
    {
        XOrigin = -400,
        YOrigin = -400,
        XYScale = 1e10,
        MOrigin = 0,
        MScale = 1e4,
    },
    EnsureValidCoordinatesRange = true,
};
```
In this step, we define precision grid options for the File GDB layer. We specify the X and Y origins, XY scale, M origin, M scale, and ensure that valid coordinate ranges are enforced.
## Step 3: Create a Layer
```csharp
using (var layer = dataset.CreateLayer("layer_name", options, SpatialReferenceSystem.Wgs84))
{
```
Here, we create a new layer within the dataset with the specified name and options. We use the WGS84 spatial reference system.
## Step 4: Add Features to the Layer
```csharp
var feature = layer.ConstructFeature();
feature.Geometry = new Point(10, 20) { M = 10.1282 };
layer.Add(feature);
feature = layer.ConstructFeature();
feature.Geometry = new Point(-410, 0) { M = 20.2343 };
```
In this step, we construct features with point geometries and add them to the layer. Note that adding a feature with coordinates outside the defined precision grid will throw an exception.
## Step 5: Handle Exceptions
```csharp
try
{
    layer.Add(feature);
}
catch (GisException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message); // X value -410 is out of valid range.
}
```
Here, we handle exceptions that may occur when adding features to the layer outside the valid coordinate range.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to define a precision grid for a File GDB layer using Aspose.GIS for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can efficiently work with geospatial data in your .NET applications.
