# Read Object ID from File GDB Layer In Aspose.GIS

## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on mastering Aspose.GIS for .NET! Aspose.GIS is a powerful library designed to handle geospatial data processing and visualization tasks efficiently within the .NET framework. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey in geospatial programming, this tutorial will walk you through everything you need to know to harness the full potential of Aspose.GIS.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Visual Studio: Ensure that you have Visual Studio installed on your system, as we'll be using it to write and run our .NET code.
   
2. Aspose.GIS for .NET: You'll need to download and install Aspose.GIS for .NET. You can obtain the library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to understand and implement the examples provided in this tutorial.

## Importing Namespaces
To get started with Aspose.GIS for .NET, you need to import the required namespaces into your C# code. Follow these steps:
## Step 1: Add References to Aspose.GIS
Begin by adding references to the Aspose.GIS library in your Visual Studio project. You can either do this by directly referencing the DLL files or by installing the package via NuGet.
## Step 2: Import Namespaces
Next, import the necessary namespaces at the beginning of your C# file. This allows you to access the classes and methods provided by Aspose.GIS.
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

Now, let's break down the provided code snippet into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define Data Directory
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory containing your File Geodatabase (GDB) files.
## Step 2: Open Dataset and Layer
```csharp
string path = dataDir + "test.gdb";
using (var dataset = Dataset.Open(path, Drivers.FileGdb))
using (var layer = dataset.OpenLayer("layer"))
{
    // Code to read object IDs goes here
}
```
This step opens the dataset and layer from the specified GDB file (`test.gdb`). Ensure that the correct driver (`FileGdb`) is used to open the dataset.
## Step 3: Iterate Through Features
```csharp
foreach (var feature in layer)
{
    // Code to process each feature goes here
}
```
Here, we iterate through each feature in the layer retrieved from the dataset.
## Step 4: Retrieve Object ID
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(feature.GetValue<int>("OBJECTID"));
```
Within the loop, we retrieve and print the value of the "OBJECTID" attribute for each feature.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of using Aspose.GIS for .NET to read Object IDs from a File Geodatabase layer. By following the step-by-step guide and understanding the code examples provided, you're now equipped to explore more advanced geospatial data processing tasks with Aspose.GIS.
