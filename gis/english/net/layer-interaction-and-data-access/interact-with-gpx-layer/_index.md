# Interact with GPX Layer

## Introduction
Are you ready to take your geospatial applications to the next level? Aspose.GIS for .NET provides a powerful set of tools to work with Geographic Information System (GIS) data seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of interacting with GPX (GPS Exchange Format) layers using Aspose.GIS for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with GIS, this step-by-step guide will help you harness the capabilities of this robust library.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.GIS for .NET library, which you can download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to kickstart your GPX layer interaction. Add the following lines at the beginning of your C# code:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Formats.Gpx;
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using Aspose.GIS.Examples.CSharp;
using System;
using System.Linq;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps for a comprehensive guide.
## Step 1: Set the Document Directory
Start by setting the path to your document directory. Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your GPX file is located.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Read GPX Features
Now, open the GPX layer and iterate through its features. We'll handle different types of GPX geometries accordingly.
```csharp
using (var layer = Drivers.Gpx.OpenLayer(dataDir + "schiehallion.gpx"))
{
    foreach (var feature in layer)
    {
        switch (feature.Geometry.GeometryType)
        {
            // Handle GPX waypoints (features with point geometry).
            case GeometryType.Point:
                Console.WriteLine(feature.Geometry.Dimension);
                // HandleGpxWaypoint(feature);
                break;
            // Handle GPX routes (features with line string geometry).
            case GeometryType.LineString:
                // HandleGpxRoute(feature);
                LineString ls = (LineString)feature.Geometry;
                foreach (var point in ls)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(point.AsText());
                }
                break;
            // Handle GPX tracks (features with multi-line string geometry).
            // Every track segment is a line string.
            case GeometryType.MultiLineString:
                // HandleGpxTrack(feature);
                Console.WriteLine(feature.Geometry.AsText());
                break;
            default: break;
        }
    }
}
```
With these steps, you've successfully interacted with the GPX layer using Aspose.GIS for .NET.
