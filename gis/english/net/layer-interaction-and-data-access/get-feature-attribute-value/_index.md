# Get Feature Attribute Value

## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Aspose.GIS for .NET, a powerful library that empowers .NET developers to seamlessly work with geographic information system (GIS) data. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey into GIS, this tutorial will guide you through the process of retrieving feature attribute values using Aspose.GIS for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A basic understanding of .NET development.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.GIS for .NET library, which you can download from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
- Familiarity with GIS concepts and terminology.
## Import Namespaces
To kickstart your project, ensure that you import the necessary namespaces. This step is crucial for accessing the functionality provided by Aspose.GIS for .NET. Include the following namespaces in your code:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```
## Tutorial: Get Feature Attribute Value
## Step 1: Set up Your Project
Create a new .NET project in Visual Studio and reference the Aspose.GIS library.
## Step 2: Define Your Document Directory
Set the path to your documents directory. This is where your shapefile (InputShapeFile.shp) is located.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 3: Open the Vector Layer
Open the vector layer using Aspose.GIS. Make sure to specify the driver, in this case, the Shapefile driver.
```csharp
using (VectorLayer layer = VectorLayer.Open(dataDir + "InputShapeFile.shp", Drivers.Shapefile))
{
    // Your code for processing the vector layer goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Retrieve Feature Attribute Values
Now, loop through each feature in the layer and retrieve attribute values. Aspose.GIS provides different ways to fetch values.
### Case 1: Explicit Type Casting
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < layer.Count; i++)
{
    Feature feature = layer[i];
    Console.WriteLine("Entry {0} information\n ========================", i);
    string nameValue = feature.GetValue<string>("name"); // attribute name is case-sensitive
    int ageValue = feature.GetValue<int>("age");
    string dobValue = feature.GetValue<DateTime>("dob").ToString();
    Console.WriteLine("Attribute value for feature #{0} is: {1}, {2}", nameValue, ageValue, dobValue);
}
```
### Case 2: Dynamic Type Casting
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < layer.Count; i++)
{
    Feature feature = layer[i];
    Console.WriteLine("Entry {0} information\n ========================", i);
    var objName = feature.GetValue("name"); // attribute name is case-sensitive
    var objAge = feature.GetValue("age");
    var objDob = feature.GetValue("dob");
    Console.WriteLine("Attribute object for feature #{0} is: {1}, {2}", objName, objAge, objDob);
}
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use Aspose.GIS for .NET to retrieve feature attribute values. This tutorial has equipped you with the foundational knowledge to integrate GIS functionality seamlessly into your .NET applications.
