# Unlocking TopoJSON Features with Aspose.GIS for .NET

## Introduction
Aspose.GIS for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to work with geospatial data effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll delve into accessing features in TopoJSON using Aspose.GIS for .NET. TopoJSON is a format that represents geographical features in a compact and efficient manner.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- A working knowledge of C# and .NET.
- Aspose.GIS for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
- Sample TopoJSON file for testing. You can find one in the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/gis/net/).
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# code:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using System;
using System.Text;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Begin by creating a new C# project and adding Aspose.GIS for .NET as a reference. Ensure that your project is configured to use the library.
## Step 2: Load TopoJSON Data
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sampleTopoJsonPath = dataDir + "sample.topojson";
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
// Open the TopoJSON file
using (VectorLayer layer = VectorLayer.Open(sampleTopoJsonPath, Drivers.TopoJson))
{
    // Iterate through each feature in the layer
    foreach (Feature feature in layer)
    {
        // get id property
        int id = feature.GetValue<int>("id");
        // get name of the object that contains this feature
        string objectName = feature.GetValue<string>("topojson_object_name");
        // get name attribute property, located inside 'properties' object
        string name = feature.GetValue<string>("name");
        // get geometry of the feature.
        string geometry = feature.Geometry.AsText();
        // Build the output string
        builder.AppendFormat("Feature with ID {0}:\n", id);
        builder.AppendFormat("Object Name = {0}\n", objectName);
        builder.AppendFormat("Name        = {0}\n", name);
        builder.AppendFormat("Geometry    = {0}\n", geometry);
    }
}
// Display the output
Console.WriteLine("Output:");
Console.WriteLine(builder.ToString());
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully accessed features in TopoJSON using Aspose.GIS for .NET. This tutorial covered the basic steps to get you started, but there's much more you can explore with the library.
