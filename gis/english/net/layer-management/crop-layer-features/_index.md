# Crop Layer Features

## Introduction
In the vast realm of geospatial data processing, Aspose.GIS for .NET emerges as a powerful tool, offering developers a seamless experience in handling geographic information. This tutorial will guide you through the process of cropping layer features using Aspose.GIS, allowing you to tailor your geospatial data to meet specific requirements.
## Prerequisites
Before delving into the magic of geospatial manipulation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.GIS for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.GIS library installed in your .NET project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
- Document Directory: Set up a directory to store your documents. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the provided code with the actual path to your document directory.
Now, let's dive into the step-by-step guide.
## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces to harness the full power of Aspose.GIS:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
```
## Step 1: Open and Crop the Layer
Start by opening the GeoTiff layer and cropping it based on a defined polygon. This ensures that your geospatial data is refined to a specific area of interest.
```csharp
using (var layer = Drivers.GeoTiff.OpenLayer(Path.Combine(filesPath, "geodetic_world.tif")))
using (var warped = layer.Crop(Geometry.FromText("POLYGON ((-160 0, 0 60, 160 0, 0 -160, -160 0))")))
{
```
## Step 2: Retrieve Raster Information
Once the layer is cropped, extract essential information about the raster data, such as cell size, spatial reference system, and bounds.
```csharp
// read and print raster
var cellSize = warped.CellSize;
var extent = warped.GetExtent();
var spatialRefSys = warped.SpatialReferenceSystem;
var code = spatialRefSys == null ? "'no srs'" : spatialRefSys.EpsgCode.ToString();
var bounds = warped.Bounds;
```
## Step 3: Display Information
Print the extracted information to understand the impact of the cropping process on your geospatial data.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"cellSize: {cellSize}");
Console.WriteLine($"source extent: {layer.GetExtent()}");
Console.WriteLine($"target extent: {extent}");
Console.WriteLine($"spatialRefSys: {code}");
Console.WriteLine($"bounds: {bounds}");
```
Repeat these steps as needed to refine and tailor your geospatial data to meet specific project requirements.
## Conclusion
Aspose.GIS for .NET opens a realm of possibilities for developers working with geospatial data. By following this step-by-step guide, you've learned how to crop layer features efficiently, providing a foundation for more advanced geospatial manipulations.
