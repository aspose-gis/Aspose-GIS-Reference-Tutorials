## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** How do I **create new shapefile** files programmatically?  
**A:** Use the `Shapefile` class in Aspose.GIS, specify the geometry type, add fields, then write features. The linked “Create New Shapefile” tutorial shows the exact code.

**Q:** What is the difference between a File GDB and a shapefile?  
**A:** A File Geodatabase (File GDB) stores data in a folder‑based structure with richer schema support, while a shapefile is a simple, widely‑compatible format consisting of several fixed‑length files.

**Q:** How can I **filter features by attribute** efficiently?  
**A:** Build a `Query` object with a WHERE clause (e.g., `SELECT * FROM layer WHERE Population > 1000`). The “Filter Features by Attribute” guide walks you through the API.

**Q:** Can I convert a shapefile to GeoJSON without intermediate files?  
**A:** Yes—load the shapefile into a `FeatureCollection` and call `ExportToGeoJson()` directly. See the “Extract Features to GeoJSON” tutorial for a complete example.

**Q:** Do I need a special license to run these examples locally?  
**A:** A free evaluation license works for development and testing. For production deployments, purchase a commercial license from Aspose.
