# Convert GeoJSON to TopoJSON with Specific Object Name

## Introduction
Aspose.GIS for .NET is a powerful tool for working with geographic data in .NET applications. Whether you're developing a mapping application, analyzing spatial data, or manipulating geojson files, Aspose.GIS provides a comprehensive set of features to streamline your workflow.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into converting GeoJSON to TopoJSON with a specific object name using Aspose.GIS for .NET, ensure you have the following:
### 1. Install Aspose.GIS for .NET
Head to the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/) and grab the latest version of Aspose.GIS for .NET.
### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Make sure you have Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment set up on your system.
### 3. Get Your GeoJSON File Ready
Have a GeoJSON file that you want to convert to TopoJSON. If you don't have one, you can use any sample GeoJSON file for this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces
Before we start the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Formats.TopoJson;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

## Step 1: Define File Paths
```csharp
string sampleGeoJsonPath = "Your Document Directory" + "sample.geojson";
var outputFilePath = "Your Document Directory" + "convertedSampleWithObjectName_out.topojson";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory path where your GeoJSON file is located and where you want to save the converted TopoJSON file.
## Step 2: Set Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new ConversionOptions
{
    DestinationDriverOptions = new TopoJsonOptions
    {
        // specify the name of the object where features should be written
        DefaultObjectName = "name_of_the_object",
    }
};
```
In this step, we create a `ConversionOptions` object and specify `DefaultObjectName`, which is the name of the object where features should be written in the resulting TopoJSON file.
## Step 3: Perform Conversion
```csharp
VectorLayer.Convert(sampleGeoJsonPath, Drivers.GeoJson, outputFilePath, Drivers.TopoJson, options);
```
Finally, we call the `Convert` method of `VectorLayer` class, passing in the path of the input GeoJSON file, input and output drivers, and conversion options.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert GeoJSON to TopoJSON with a specific object name using Aspose.GIS for .NET. By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and manipulate geographic data in your .NET applications.
