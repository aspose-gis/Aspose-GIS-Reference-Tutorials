# Get Geometry Type with Aspose.GIS for .NET

## Introduction
In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.GIS serves as a powerful tool for handling geographical information. Its rich functionalities make it a go-to choice for developers working with spatial data. In this tutorial, we will delve into the basics of Aspose.GIS for .NET, breaking down key concepts and providing step-by-step guidance to help you get started with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into Aspose.GIS for .NET, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:
### .NET Environment Setup
1. Install .NET SDK: Begin by installing the .NET SDK suitable for your operating system. You can download it from the .NET website or use a package manager like NuGet.
2. IDE Installation: Choose your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider. Install and configure it according to your preferences.
3. Aspose.GIS Installation: Download and install Aspose.GIS for .NET from the provided [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
4. API Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the [Aspose.GIS for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/gis/net/). It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the library's functionalities and usage.

## Import Namespaces
In any .NET project utilizing Aspose.GIS, you need to import the required namespaces to access its classes and methods efficiently. Follow these steps:
## Step 1: Open Your .NET Project
Launch your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
## Step 2: Add Aspose.GIS Namespace
In your code file, import the necessary namespace for Aspose.GIS:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```
By including this namespace, you gain access to the core functionalities of Aspose.GIS within your project.
## Break Down Each Example into Multiple Steps
Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps for better understanding and implementation.
## Step 1: Create a Point Object
```csharp
Point point = new Point(40.7128, -74.006);
```
In this step, we instantiate a new `Point` object, representing a geographical point with latitude 40.7128 and longitude -74.006.
## Step 2: Retrieve Geometry Type
```csharp
GeometryType geometryType = point.GeometryType;
```
Here, we retrieve the geometry type of the created point object using the `GeometryType` property.
## Step 3: Display Geometry Type
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(geometryType); // Point
```
Finally, we print the geometry type to the console. In this case, the output will be "Point," indicating that the object represents a point in the geographical space.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've provided a foundational understanding of Aspose.GIS for .NET, covering essential prerequisites, namespace imports, and a step-by-step breakdown of a basic example. Armed with this knowledge, you're now equipped to explore further and harness the capabilities of Aspose.GIS to handle spatial data efficiently in your .NET projects.
