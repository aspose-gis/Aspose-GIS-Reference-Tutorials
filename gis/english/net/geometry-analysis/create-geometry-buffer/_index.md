# Create Geometry Buffer

## Introduction
In the realm of geospatial programming, Aspose.GIS for .NET stands out as a powerful tool. With its robust features and intuitive interface, developers can efficiently handle geographic data, perform spatial analysis, and create stunning visualizations. In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll delve into the essential aspects of Aspose.GIS for .NET, breaking down key functionalities and providing step-by-step guidance for beginners and experienced developers alike.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on our journey with Aspose.GIS for .NET, it's essential to ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites in place:
### Installing Aspose.GIS for .NET
1. Download the Aspose.GIS for .NET Library: Navigate to the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/) and acquire the latest version of the Aspose.GIS for .NET library.
2. Integration with Visual Studio: Once downloaded, integrate the library into your Visual Studio environment by adding it as a reference in your project.
3. Acquiring a License: Obtain a valid license from [Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to unlock the full potential of the Aspose.GIS for .NET library. Alternatively, you can utilize a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for testing purposes.

## Importing Namespaces
To begin utilizing the functionalities of Aspose.GIS for .NET, it's crucial to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This allows access to classes and methods essential for geospatial operations.
## Step 1: Importing Aspose.GIS Namespace
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

Now, let's dissect the provided examples into multiple steps, elucidating each step along the way.
## Step 1: Create a Geometry Buffer
```csharp
// Define a LineString geometry
var line = new LineString();
line.AddPoint(0, 0);
line.AddPoint(3, 3);
```
In this step, we create a LineString geometry object and add two points to define a line from (0,0) to (3,3).
## Step 2: Generate Buffer for LineString
```csharp
// Generate a buffer for the LineString with a positive distance
var lineBuffer = line.GetBuffer(distance: 1);
```
Here, we create a buffer around the LineString with a specified positive distance, which contains all points within the specified distance from the input geometry.
## Step 3: Check Spatial Containment
```csharp
// Check spatial containment of points within the buffer
Console.WriteLine(lineBuffer.SpatiallyContains(new Point(1, 2)));     // True
Console.WriteLine(lineBuffer.SpatiallyContains(new Point(3.1, 3.1))); // True
```
We test spatial containment by checking if specific points lie within the generated buffer, returning a boolean value indicating containment.
## Step 4: Define a Polygon Geometry
```csharp
// Define a Polygon geometry
var polygon = new Polygon();
polygon.ExteriorRing = new LinearRing(new[]
{
    new Point(0, 0),
    new Point(0, 3),
    new Point(3, 3),
    new Point(3, 0),
    new Point(0, 0),
});
```
Here, we create a Polygon geometry object with an exterior ring defined by a sequence of points.
## Step 5: Generate Buffer for Polygon
```csharp
// Generate a buffer for the Polygon with a negative distance
var polygonBuffer = (IPolygon)polygon.GetBuffer(distance: -1);
```
We create a buffer around the Polygon with a specified negative distance, causing the geometry to 'shrink' inward.
## Step 6: Access Buffer Exterior Ring Points
```csharp
// Access points of the exterior ring of the buffer Polygon
var ring = polygonBuffer.ExteriorRing;
for (int i = 0; i < ring.Count; ++i)
{
    Console.WriteLine("[{0}] = ({1} {2})", i, ring[i].X, ring[i].Y);
}
```
Finally, we retrieve and iterate through the points comprising the exterior ring of the buffered Polygon, displaying their coordinates.
