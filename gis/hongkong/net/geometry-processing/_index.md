## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I convert large collections of geometries to WKT efficiently?**  
A: Yes. Load geometries in batches, optionally set `CoordinatePrecision` to reduce string length, and use `Parallel.ForEach` for multi‑threaded conversion.

**Q: Does converting to WKT affect the original geometry object?**  
A: No. The `ToWkt()` method returns a string representation without modifying the source `Geometry` instance.

**Q: How do I control the number of decimal places in the WKT output?**  
A: Adjust the `Geometry.PrecisionModel` or format the result with `String.Format` after conversion.

**Q: Is WKT supported for 3D geometries (Z and M values)?**  
A: Aspose.GIS includes Z and M coordinates in the WKT output when the geometry contains them, following the EWKT specification.

**Q: Which .NET versions are compatible with these tutorials?**  
A: The examples work with .NET Framework 4.6.1+, .NET Core 3.1+, and .NET 6/7.
