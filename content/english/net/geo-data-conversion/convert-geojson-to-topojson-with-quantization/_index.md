## Introduction
In the realm of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), converting data formats is a common necessity, especially when optimizing for specific use cases. TopoJSON, known for its compactness and efficiency in representing geographic data, offers a valuable format for such purposes. Aspose.GIS for .NET provides robust tools to facilitate this conversion seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.GIS for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.GIS for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
2. GeoJSON Data: Prepare the GeoJSON file that you intend to convert. Ensure it's accessible from your .NET environment.

## Import Namespaces
To start with the conversion process, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Formats.TopoJson;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```
## Step 1: Define Paths and Output File
Begin by defining the paths for your input GeoJSON file and the desired output TopoJSON file. Adjust the file paths accordingly.
```csharp
string SampleGeoJsonPath = "Your Document Directory" + "sample.geojson";
var outputFilePath = "Your Document Directory" + "convertedSampleWithQuantization_out.topojson";
```
## Step 2: Specify Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options, especially focusing on quantization for TopoJSON. This step allows you to optimize the output file size and precision according to your requirements.
```csharp
var options = new ConversionOptions
{
    DestinationDriverOptions = new TopoJsonOptions
    {
        QuantizationNumber = 100_000,
    }
};
```
## Step 3: Perform Conversion
Execute the conversion process using Aspose.GIS methods. This step involves invoking the `Convert` method from `VectorLayer` with appropriate parameters.
```csharp
VectorLayer.Convert(SampleGeoJsonPath, Drivers.GeoJson, outputFilePath, Drivers.TopoJson, options);
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, leveraging Aspose.GIS for .NET simplifies the conversion of GeoJSON to TopoJSON with quantization. By following the outlined steps, you can efficiently transform geographic data while optimizing file size and precision for your specific needs.
