## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on using Aspose.GIS for .NET to convert GeoJSON to TopoJSON with grouping. Aspose.GIS is a powerful .NET API that allows developers to work with geographic data seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of converting GeoJSON files to TopoJSON while grouping features based on specified attributes.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Aspose.GIS for .NET: Ensure you have downloaded and installed the Aspose.GIS for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).

2. Development Environment: You should have a working development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.

3. Sample GeoJSON File: Prepare a sample GeoJSON file that you want to convert. You can obtain sample GeoJSON files from various sources or create your own.

## Import Namespaces

First, make sure to include the necessary namespaces in your project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Formats.TopoJson;
```


Now let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Define File Paths

Define the paths for your input GeoJSON file and the output TopoJSON file:

```csharp
string sampleGeoJsonPath = "Your Document Directory" + "sample.geojson";
var outputFilePath = "Your Document Directory" + "convertedSampleWithGrouping_out.topojson";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory where your files are located.

## Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Configure the conversion options to specify how the grouping should be performed. In this example, we will group features based on a specific attribute.

```csharp
var options = new ConversionOptions
{
    DestinationDriverOptions = new TopoJsonOptions
    {
        // Specify the attribute in GeoJSON layer by which we are going to group into objects
        ObjectNameAttribute = "group",
        // Specify the default object name for features with unknown attribute values
        DefaultObjectName = "unnamed",
    }
};
```

Adjust the `ObjectNameAttribute` and `DefaultObjectName` properties according to your GeoJSON data.

## Step 3: Perform Conversion

Execute the conversion process using Aspose.GIS API:

```csharp
VectorLayer.Convert(sampleGeoJsonPath, Drivers.GeoJson, outputFilePath, Drivers.TopoJson, options);
```

This line of code will convert the GeoJSON file to TopoJSON with the specified grouping options.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to convert GeoJSON to TopoJSON with grouping using Aspose.GIS for .NET. By following these simple steps, you can efficiently handle geographic data formats in your .NET applications.
