## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into the conversion process from TopoJSON to GeoJSON using Aspose.GIS for .NET. Aspose.GIS is a powerful API designed to facilitate geographical information processing within .NET applications. TopoJSON and GeoJSON are widely used formats for representing geographical data, and being able to convert between them is essential for various GIS applications.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Aspose.GIS for .NET: Make sure you have downloaded and installed the Aspose.GIS for .NET library. You can download it from the [Aspose.GIS website](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
2. Development Environment: You need a working development environment with .NET installed.
3. Sample TopoJSON File: Have a sample TopoJSON file ready for conversion. If you don't have one, you can create or obtain it from various sources.

## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding with the conversion, import the necessary namespaces to your project. These namespaces will provide access to the functionality needed for TopoJSON to GeoJSON conversion.

   ```csharp
using Aspose.Gis;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

Now that you have set up your environment and imported the required namespaces, let's break down the process of converting TopoJSON to GeoJSON into step-by-step instructions.
## Step 1: Specify Input and Output Paths

Define the paths for the input TopoJSON file and the output GeoJSON file.
```csharp
var sampleTopoJsonPath = "Your Document Directory" + "sample.topojson";
var outputFilePath = "Your Document Directory" + "convertedSample_out.geojson";
```
## Step 2: Perform Conversion Utilize the `VectorLayer.Convert` method to convert TopoJSON to GeoJSON.
```csharp
VectorLayer.Convert(sampleTopoJsonPath, Drivers.TopoJson, outputFilePath, Drivers.GeoJson);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to convert TopoJSON to GeoJSON using Aspose.GIS for .NET. By following the outlined steps and utilizing the Aspose.GIS library, you can seamlessly handle geographical data conversions within your .NET applications.
