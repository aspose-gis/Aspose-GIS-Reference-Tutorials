## Introduction
In the realm of geospatial data handling and analysis, Aspose.GIS for .NET emerges as a powerful toolset, empowering developers to manipulate, visualize, and process geographic information seamlessly within .NET applications. This article serves as a comprehensive guide to leveraging Aspose.GIS for .NET effectively, catering to both novice and seasoned developers alike.
## Prerequisites
Before delving into the intricacies of Aspose.GIS for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install Aspose.GIS for .NET
Firstly, download and install Aspose.GIS for .NET from the [release page](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation to integrate it into your .NET environment seamlessly.
### 2. Familiarity with .NET Development
A fundamental understanding of the .NET framework and C# programming language is essential to grasp the concepts discussed throughout this tutorial.
### 3. IDE Setup
Set up your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the necessary configurations to develop .NET applications. Ensure that you have a working environment conducive to .NET development.
### 4. Basic Geospatial Concepts
While not mandatory, familiarity with basic geospatial concepts such as points, lines, and geometric collections can expedite your learning process.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the requisite namespaces to access the functionalities provided by Aspose.GIS for .NET efficiently.

```csharp
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```


Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps to understand the process of iterating over geometries in a collection using Aspose.GIS for .NET.
## Step 1: Create Geometric Objects
Instantiate point and line geometries using the provided coordinates.
```csharp
Point pointGeometry = new Point(40.7128, -74.006);
LineString lineGeometry = new LineString();
lineGeometry.AddPoint(78.65, -32.65);
lineGeometry.AddPoint(-98.65, 12.65);
```
## Step 2: Populate Geometry Collection
Construct a geometry collection and add the created geometries to it.
```csharp
GeometryCollection geometryCollection = new GeometryCollection();
geometryCollection.Add(pointGeometry);
geometryCollection.Add(lineGeometry);
```
## Step 3: Iterate Over Geometries
Loop through the geometry collection and handle each geometry based on its type.
```csharp
foreach (Geometry geometry in geometryCollection)
{
    switch (geometry.GeometryType)
    {
        case GeometryType.Point:
            Point point = (Point)geometry;
            // Handle point geometry
            break;
        case GeometryType.LineString:
            LineString line = (LineString)geometry;
            // Handle line geometry
            break;
    }
}
```
