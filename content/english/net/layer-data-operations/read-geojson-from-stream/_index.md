## Introduction
Welcome to our step-by-step guide on using Aspose.GIS for .NET to read GeoJSON from a stream. Aspose.GIS is a powerful API that provides geospatial capabilities to .NET applications, allowing you to work with various GIS formats seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of reading GeoJSON data from a stream using Aspose.GIS, breaking down each step for clarity and ease of understanding.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: You should be familiar with C# programming language and its syntax.
2. Installation of Aspose.GIS: Ensure that you have installed Aspose.GIS for .NET. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
3. Development Environment: Set up your preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

## Import Namespaces
To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Gis;
```

## Step 1: Define GeoJSON Data
First, we need to define the GeoJSON data as a string in our C# code. For example:
```csharp
const string geoJson = @"{""type"":""FeatureCollection"",""features"":[
    {""type"":""Feature"",""geometry"":{""type"":""Point"",""coordinates"":[0, 1]},""properties"":{""name"":""John""}},
    {""type"":""Feature"",""geometry"":{""type"":""Point"",""coordinates"":[2, 3]},""properties"":{""name"":""Mary""}}
]}";
```
## Step 2: Read GeoJSON from Stream
Next, we'll read the GeoJSON data from a stream using Aspose.GIS:
```csharp
using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(geoJson)))
using (var layer = VectorLayer.Open(AbstractPath.FromStream(memoryStream), Drivers.GeoJson))
{
    Console.WriteLine(layer.Count); // Output: 2
    Console.WriteLine(layer[1].GetValue<string>("name")); // Output: Mary
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to read GeoJSON data from a stream using Aspose.GIS for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can integrate geospatial capabilities into your .NET applications effortlessly.
