## Introduction
Are you looking to harness the power of GeoJSON in your .NET application using Aspose.GIS? Well, you're in the right place! This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of writing GeoJSON to a stream, leveraging the robust capabilities of Aspose.GIS for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.GIS for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.GIS for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/gis/net/).
2. Document Directory: Have a document directory set up in your project, and make note of its path.
Now, let's get started with the tutorial!
## Import Namespaces
First things first, make sure to include the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.GIS functionalities in your code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Gis;
using Aspose.Gis.Geometries;
```
## Step 1: Set up the Document Directory
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path to your document directory.
## Step 2: Create a Memory Stream
```csharp
using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    // Code for the next steps goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Create a Vector Layer with GeoJSON Driver
```csharp
using (var layer = VectorLayer.Create(AbstractPath.FromStream(memoryStream), Drivers.GeoJson))
{
    // Code for the next steps goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Define Feature Attributes
```csharp
layer.Attributes.Add(new FeatureAttribute("name", AttributeDataType.String));
layer.Attributes.Add(new FeatureAttribute("age", AttributeDataType.Integer));
```
## Step 5: Construct and Add Features
```csharp
// First Feature
Feature firstFeature = layer.ConstructFeature();
firstFeature.Geometry = new Point(33.97, -118.25);
firstFeature.SetValue("name", "John");
firstFeature.SetValue("age", 23);
layer.Add(firstFeature);
// Second Feature
Feature secondFeature = layer.ConstructFeature();
secondFeature.Geometry = new Point(35.81, -96.28);
secondFeature.SetValue("name", "Mary");
secondFeature.SetValue("age", 54);
layer.Add(secondFeature);
```
## Step 6: Display GeoJSON Output
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray()));
```
Congratulations! You've successfully written GeoJSON to a stream using Aspose.GIS for .NET.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we covered the fundamental steps to integrate Aspose.GIS for .NET into your project, specifically focusing on writing GeoJSON to a stream. With these simple yet powerful steps, you can enhance your application's geospatial capabilities.
